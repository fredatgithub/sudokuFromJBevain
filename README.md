# Sudoku Solver in C# 12

I recently started playing Sudoku in the games section of a popular news site.

I quickly figured I didn't know how to solve the non easy ones, so I learned the patterns to solve them.

Sometimes I'd be stuck and fail to find a pattern and it was frustrating to not know what to do. So I decided to write a solver to better understand the patterns. It's by no mean perfect and it's written to mimic the steps I'd need to do to solve a puzzle manually, and not as a general purpose solver (like a backtracking one).

Right now it has solved all the “Hard” puzzles that the NYT threw at me recently.
