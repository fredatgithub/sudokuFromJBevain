# Sudoku Solver in C# 12

I recently started playing Sudoku in the games section of a popular news site.

I quickly figured I didn't know how to solve the non easy ones, so I learned the patterns to solve them.

I figured my computer would be a lot faster at solving them than I am, so I wrote this solver. It's by no mean complete.

But right now it has solved all the “Hard” puzzles that the NYT threw at me recently.
